## Some jupyter resources:
<li>
<ul> nbviewer : NBViewer is the most popular notebook renderer on the web. If you already have somewhere to host your Jupyter Notebooks online, be it GitHub or elsewhere, NBViewer will render your notebook and provide a shareable URL along with it. Provided as a free service as part of Project Jupyter, it is available at nbviewer.jupyter.org.
